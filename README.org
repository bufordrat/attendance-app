* Description
  =Attendance App= is a is a Ruby on Rails app that teachers can use
  to take attendance in their classrooms.  The teacher logs in under
  =teacher mode= and enters the dates for all upcoming class sessions.
  Before each class session, the teacher selects one of these class
  sessions to activate.  While that class session is activated,
  students can log in under =student mode= and demonstrate that they
  were in attendance by entering the correct randomly generated
  four-digit code.  The student can see which class sessions they were
  and weren't present for, and the teacher can access attendance data
  on all their students for the semester at a quick glance.  The app
  also features a submission log feature for help with troubleshooting
  that maintains a log of each student's code submission attempts.
